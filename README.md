# Entropy-Project

Problem:
Consider two Einstein solids, A and B, that are "weakly coupled" so that they can exchange energy. Suppose the numbers of oscillators in the two solids are NA and NB and that they are sharing x units of energy. Write a program to calculate the various macrostates and their multiplicities and entropies for both A and B. Produce a graph of Entropy vs qA. Continue to also compute the corresponding temperatures and draw them also a function of qA.
